Overview


As a software engineer, I aim to continuously enhance my skills and understanding of various programming languages, including C++. The software I developed serves as a demonstration of my proficiency in C++ language syntax and concepts.

The software is a simple command-line application that allows users to input their favorite scriptures along with accompanying spiritual thoughts. The program then sorts and displays the scriptures in alphabetical order based on their references. Additionally, users can search for a specific scripture by its reference.

My purpose for writing this software is twofold. Firstly, I aimed to reinforce my understanding of fundamental C++ concepts such as classes, vectors, string manipulation, and algorithms like sorting and searching. Secondly, I wanted to create a practical application that showcases my ability to write clean, organized, and functional code in C++.

Development Environment

I developed the software using Xcode, an integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed for macOS development. Xcode provides a comprehensive set of tools for writing, debugging, and testing C++ code, making it an ideal environment for this project.

The programming language used for this project is C++. Additionally, I utilized standard libraries such as <iostream> for input/output operations, <vector> for dynamic arrays, <algorithm> for sorting and searching algorithms, and a custom header file "scripture.hpp" defining the Scripture class.

Useful Websites
During the development of this project, I found the following websites helpful for reference, tutorials, and troubleshooting:

cplusplus.com: A comprehensive resource for C++ documentation, tutorials, and reference materials.
Stack Overflow: An invaluable community-driven Q&A platform for programming-related queries and problem-solving.
